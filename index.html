            <p>Project Shae is looking for you!</p>

            <p>With project Shae we aim at developing a system that is able to map the position of humans with drones.</p>

            <p>
                The project consists of multiple parts:
                - front-end application (interface of the operator)
                - machine learning component (interpreting sensor information to detect humans)
                - drone specific components (the 3DRobotics Solo will be used)

                As you can see the project contains both low-level progamming in addition to advanced high-level algorithmic components.

                So, do you:
                 - want to work with us on this exciting project,
                 - like machine learning,
                 - love working with drones?

                Just send us an email (vincent.dutordoir@ugent.be).
